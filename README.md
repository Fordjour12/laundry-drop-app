## Typography System

In our Flutter project, we have defined a typography system in the `MyAppTypography` class. Here's a brief explanation:

- `bd` stands for body text.
- `hd` stands for heading text.
- `b` stands for bold text.
- `m` stands for medium weight text.
- `bl` stands for black weight text.
- `l` stands for light weight text.
- `r` stands for regular weight text.

For example, `bd18m` represents a body text style with a font size of 18 and a medium font weight.

Here are some examples of our typography styles:

- `bd18m`: Body text, font size 18, medium weight.
- `hd32b`: Heading text, font size 32, bold weight.

We use the `TextStyle` widget from Flutter's material library to define these styles.
